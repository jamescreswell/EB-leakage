# EB-leakage

This repository contains some code related to correction of E-to-B leakage in CMB science.

## Papers

See [1811.04691](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04691), [1904.00451](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00451), and [1906.10381](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10381).

## Idea and motivation

A new method for correcting E-to-B leakage is presented. The idea is explained in [1811.04691](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04691). 
It can be combined with the MASTER method to reconstruct the full-sky B-mode spectrum.

## Code 

`leakage.py` contains some scripts, written in Python 3 using `numpy` and `healpy` (IN PROGRESS)
